# Healthonomics: Analyzing the Financial Impact of Chronic Diseases on Healthcare Systems

This project investigates how chronic diseases like diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular conditions financially burden healthcare systems globally. Using data from the World Health Organization (WHO) and World Bank, we built predictive models to uncover cost-driving patterns and help guide policy decisions.

---

## 💡 Project Objectives

- Quantify the financial impact of chronic diseases on national healthcare expenditures.
- Identify high-risk countries and disease profiles using regression and clustering analysis.
- Provide data-driven insights for healthcare policy and investment planning.

---

## 📊 Data Sources

- **World Health Organization (WHO)**: Disease prevalence and incidence rates
- **World Bank**: Healthcare spending, GDP, and population indicators

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebooks
- CSV data integration
- Regression, KMeans Clustering
- EDA & Correlation Heatmaps

---

## 🔍 Key Features

- 📈 Built **Multiple Linear Regression** models to predict healthcare costs.
- 🧪 Ran **KMeans Clustering** to segment countries based on chronic disease burden and economic metrics.
- 🌍 Created **country-level visualizations** to highlight global trends.
- 📌 Shared **policy implications** for strategic global health funding.

## 📈 Sample Insights

- Countries with lower GDP per capita often spend a higher percentage of their income on chronic disease care.
- Diabetes and cardiovascular diseases are the most financially taxing conditions globally.
- Health investment gaps are strongly correlated with disease mortality rates.

## 🎯 Impact

This project helps policymakers and healthcare researchers understand where to allocate resources effectively and highlights the need for preventative care investments.
